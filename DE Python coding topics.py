🔥 CORE PYTHON CODING TOPICS FOR DATA ENGINEERING

1️⃣ Strings (Basics → Moderate)
1. Reverse a string / words
2. Count characters / words
3. Remove duplicates
4. Run-length encoding (abbccc → a1b2c3)
5. Parse CSV / log strings
6. Extract file extension, date, IDs
👉 Why asked? Raw data is mostly text (logs, JSON, CSV).

2️⃣ Lists & Tuples
1. Remove duplicates while keeping order
2. Flatten nested lists
3. Find max/min without built-ins
4. Merge / split lists
5. Sliding window problems
👉 Why asked? Data pipelines deal with arrays, batches, partitions.

3️⃣ Dictionaries (VERY IMPORTANT 🔥)
1. Count frequency (words, events)
2. Group data by key
3. Convert list → dict
4. Find top-K frequent items
5. Merge dictionaries
👉 Why asked? This maps directly to GROUP BY in SQL / Spark.

4️⃣ Sets
1. Remove duplicates
2. Find common / unique elements
3. Compare two datasets
👉 Why asked? Deduplication is critical in ETL.

5️⃣ Loops & Conditions (Foundation)
1. Nested loops
2. Break / continue
3. Conditional transformations
👉 Why asked? To see if you can write clean ETL logic.

6️⃣ Functions & Modular Code
1. Write reusable transformation functions
2. Default arguments
3. *args, **kwargs
👉 Why asked? Production pipelines are function-driven.

7️⃣ File Handling (IMPORTANT 🔥)
1. Read CSV / TXT file
2. Write processed output to file
3. Handle file not found errors
👉 Why asked? Data Engineers work with files constantly.

8️⃣ JSON Handling (VERY IMPORTANT 🔥🔥)
1. Parse nested JSON
2. Extract values safely
3. Flatten JSON
👉 Why asked? Most modern data comes from APIs.

9️⃣ Error Handling
1. Handle bad records
2. Try–except blocks
3. Custom exceptions
👉 Why asked? Data pipelines must not fail on bad data.

🔟 Performance & Clean Code (Mid–Senior)
1. Avoid unnecessary loops
2. Use dict instead of nested loops
3. Optimize string/list operations
👉 Why asked? Large data = performance matters.

🚫 TOPICS RARELY ASKED TO CODE (for DE roles)
❌ Complex recursion
❌ Heavy OOP design
❌ Competitive programming puzzles
❌ Advanced math algorithms

🧠 How interviewers evaluate you
They check:
1. Can you transform data
2. Can you aggregate
3. Can you clean messy input
4. Can you write readable code
Not trick questions.

🎯 MOST IMPORTANT TOPICS (PRIORITY ORDER)
1. Dictionaries
2. Strings
3. Lists
4. JSON
5. File handling
6. Error handling
7. Functions
If you master these → 90% Python coding rounds cleared.
